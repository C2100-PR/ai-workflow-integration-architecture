# AI Workflow Integration Architecture

## Overview

This repository defines the integration architecture for combining workflows across:
- Warp.app terminal workflows
- Dr. Lucy Automation
- Core Agency Systems
- Anthology AI Publishing Platform
- Model Function Execution Framework

## Core Components

### 1. Universal Function Execution Layer
- Every AI model gets access to a standardized function execution environment
- Models can generate and execute code within their domain expertise
- Security sandboxing and access control per model

### 2. Workflow Integration Points

#### Warp.app Integration
- Custom AI command palette integration
- Workflow recording and automation
- Terminal command suggestions and completions
- Git operations automation
- Development environment optimization

#### Dr. Lucy Automation
- Medical workflow automation
- Patient data processing
- Healthcare protocol execution
- Medical documentation generation
- Healthcare compliance checks

#### Agency Integration
- Client workflow automation
- Project management automation 
- Resource allocation optimization
- Timeline and milestone tracking
- Client communication automation

#### Anthology AI Publishing
- Content workflow automation
- Editorial process management
- Publication scheduling
- Distribution channel integration
- Analytics and performance tracking

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation Layer
1. Establish universal function execution framework
2. Implement security and access control
3. Create model-specific sandboxes
4. Set up monitoring and logging

### Phase 2: Core Integrations
1. Warp.app terminal integration
2. Dr. Lucy core systems
3. Agency workflow systems
4. Publishing platform hooks

### Phase 3: Workflow Automation
1. Cross-platform workflow definitions
2. Automation triggers and actions
3. Error handling and recovery
4. Performance optimization

### Phase 4: AI Model Integration
1. Model-specific function libraries
2. Domain expertise mapping
3. Cross-model collaboration
4. Learning and improvement loops
